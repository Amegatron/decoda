# Decoda v3.0 ALPHA #

A lightweight lexical string parser for BBCode styled markup.

Version(s) 3.x are not backwards compatible with 2.9 and lower. The newer versions were completely rewritten as a lexical parser that examines the string stack, where as the older versions were using archaic regex parsing. The newer versions also boast a very powerful filter and hook system, so your old code will need to be changed to support the newer functionality.
